A machine learning model is developed using historical data encompassing IPL seasons from 2008 to 2023. The model, a Random Forest classifier, achieved an accuracy of 99.87% and Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 80.38% in predicting the win/loss outcome for the batting team in the second innings.

We chose the Logistic Regression Algorithm as our final algorithm for the Model as it gives probability percentage with interesting figures which would engage the users and cricket fans as a whole. Random Forest would just give the probability with extreme 98-99 percentages.
